   Do file for cleaning and processing GSS data to make original.dta
  * [sample.do](GSS%20analysis%20using%20Stata/0401%20sample%20do.do)  
   Do file for the assignment
  * [Interpretation on performed tests.pdf](GSS%20analysis%20using%20Stata/Interpretation%20on%20performed%20tests.pdf)  
   Explanation of the test results.
  * **.dta files**  
   Data used in do file
  * **GSS.dat & GSS.dct**  
   Source data downloaded from General Social Survey, used to generate original.dta
   
   *If you would like to test the code, please make sure to change the directory in the use command.* 
   
  ## Econometrics
  A sample Stata assignment for ECON 1630 **Mathematical Econometrics**.  
  In this assignment, I prepared data and performed a DiD model.
  
  * [Problem Set 5](econ_ps5.pdf)  
  
  ## Technical vs Managerial
   The proposal + code for SOC2430 **Fields and Methods of Social Research**.  
   You can download the whole folder as a zip to test the code.
   
   * [Accessories or Parts:  Technical vs.  Managerial Hiring Patterns of Software Start-Ups at Seed Stage](Technical%20vs%20Managerial/technical-vs-managerial.pdf)  
    The research proposal in PDF
   * [Data Processing and Visualization.ipynb](Technical%20vs%20Managerial/Data%20Processing%20and%20Visualization.ipynb)  
    Python code (in Jupyter notebook) used to process and visualize json data scraped from the AngelList website.  
    This file was wrote in Deepnote and may not run properly in Anaconda / Jupyter notebook.
   * [Sentiment Analysis on Hiring Post.ipynb](Technical%20vs%20Managerial/Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20Hiring%20Post.ipynb)  
    Python code (in Jupyter notebook) used to conduct sentiment analysis on the corpus of a sample hiring post.
  ## The Heartbeat of Employment Relationship
  The paper + code for SOC2961M **Computational Methods for Social Scientists**.  
  You can download the whole folder as a zip to test the code.

   * [The Heartbeat of Employment Relationship:  How Employeesâ€™ Attitudes Toward Managers Change Over Time](The%20Heartbeat%20of%20Employment%20Relationship/Heartbeat.pdf)  
   The paper in PDF
   * [Data Collection with Tweepy.ipynb](The%20Heartbeat%20of%20Employment%20Relationship/1229%20Computational%20-%20Data%20Collection%20with%20Tweepy.ipynb)  
   Python code(in Jupyter notebook) used to collect tweets from Twitter APIs.
   * [Data Analysis with Pandas.ipynb](The%20Heartbeat%20of%20Employment%20Relationship/1229%20Computational%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20with%20Pandas.ipynb)  
   Python code(in Jupyter notebook) used to analyze collected tweets.
    
  ## Machine Learning / Hypothesis Testing
  A linear regression with gradient descent model for CSCI1951 **Data Science**.
  Done as a part of group project analyzing factors impacting the GDP and the Economy & the prediction of performance level of an industry.

   * [Prediction.ipynb](Prediction2.ipynb)  
    Python code (in Jupyter notebook) used to perform and evaluate the performance of the model with test/train datasets.
   * [The Economic Analysis Report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17LHeAneNp3uus08n9h-YjJrzZO-4OI05CQdlmxMPdMo/edit?usp=sharing)
    The project research poster. 
    I was responsible for selecting and evaluating the dataset, **Analysis #1: Job Creation & Estabs Entry** and **Impact & Challenges**.
